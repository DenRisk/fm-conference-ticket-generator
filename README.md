## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [React](https://react.dev/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I have worked with the input field of type file for the first time. This allows files to be uploaded. I also refreshed my tailwindcss and learned that you can use plugins to add your own css classes to tailwindcss, for example.
### Useful resources

- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me for writing less css.
